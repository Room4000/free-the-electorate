Project to standardize and disseminate Ontario elections results

Uses data that is available online at http://www.elections.on.ca/en/resource-centre/elections-results.html

Ontario election results are posted on the Elections Ontario website, but generally aren't readily available outside election cycles, when the information is in the press. Poll-by-poll results are available as pdfs and spreadsheets back to 2007, and prior to that only basic election results are published online.

We want to make this data more easily available to any interested parties by creating a set of standard documents (csv files) and a database, as well as creating visualizations of that data for public use.
